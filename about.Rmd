I did my masters and doctoral degrees at the [University of Hohenheim](https://www.uni-hohenheim.de/en) where I currently work as a PostDoc at the [Department of Rural Development Theory and Policy](https://entwicklungspolitik.uni-hohenheim.de/startseite). To learn more about my education, research, publications, etc, I invite you to check out my [CV](https://bwsyncandshare.kit.edu/s/gfNgKGNipi84f39).

I am a passionate researcher with a proven track record in studying livelihoods in smallholder farm households of Africa and South Asia.My primary interests revolve around agricultural and development economics, with a particular focus on food security, sustainable development, and women's empowerment. I am especially intrigued by rural development related policy and program evaluations, seeking to evaluate their effectiveness and identify areas for improvement. By examining these crucial aspects, I aim to drive positive change in the realms of agricultural and rural development.
