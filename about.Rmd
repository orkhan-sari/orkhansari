I am a passionate researcher with a proven track record in studying livelihoods in smallholder farm households of Africa and South Asia. My primary interests revolve around agricultural and development economics, with a particular focus on food security, sustainable development, and women's empowerment. I am especially intrigued by rural development related policy and program evaluations, seeking to evaluate their effectiveness and identify areas for improvement. By examining these crucial aspects, I aim to drive positive change in the realms of agricultural and rural development.

I did my masters and doctoral degrees at the [University of Hohenheim](https://www.uni-hohenheim.de/en) where I currently work as a PostDoc at the [Department of Rural Development Theory and Policy](https://entwicklungspolitik.uni-hohenheim.de/startseite). During my doctoral years, I was part of a research project in Ethiopia. Moreover, I was able to secure some joint research funds for my research in Bhutan (see the picture?). Thus, my dissertation work was partly on Ethiopia and partly on Bhutan. I feel very lucky to have had the chance to visit and do research in these countries. 

I currently teach (part of) following modules at the University of Hohenheim:

  * **Quantitative Methods in Economics**
  * **Poverty and Development Strategies**
  * **Monitoring and Evaluation of Rural Development Projects**
  * **Rural Development Policies and Institutions**
