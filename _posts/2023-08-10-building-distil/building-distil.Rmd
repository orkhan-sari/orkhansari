As my first blogpost, I am going to list here all the resources that I used when building this website. So, if you are new to `R markdown` or `distil`, I hope this post will be helpful. I am also new to both, maybe now a bit more comfortable with markdown after some projects. Good think is that there are many people who have shared their experience and are willing to teach those like us. 

I first heard of `distil` on Twitter. What do you do when you hear about anything new? You google or youtube? That is what I did too! I ended up in [Lisa Lendway's](https://lisalendway.netlify.app/) website which by the way she built with `distil`; and there is also a [Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=186&v=Fm3bsYCilEU&embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Flisalendway.netlify.app%2F&source_ve_path=MjM4NTE&feature=emb_title). This was already good enough to set up my webpage over night!
