So, if you are new to R markdown or distil, I hope this post will be helpful. I am also new to both, maybe now a bit more comfortable with markdown after some projects. Good think is that there are many people who have shared their experience and are willing to teach those like us.\r\nI first heard of distil on Twitter. What do you do when you hear about anything new? You google or youtube? That is what I did too! I ended up in Lisa Lendwayâ€™s website which by the way she built with distil; and there is also a Youtube video. This was already good enough to set up my webpage over night!\r\nNext step for me was to check example websites. I am sure by googling a bit more, one can find many other example websites built with distil that provide code publicly. One of this sources is definitely Open Source Football.\r\nI am still constructing my website, thus this blog will be updated constantly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
