So, if you are new to R markdown or distil, I hope this post will be helpful.\r\nI first heard of distil on Twitter. What do you do when you hear about anything new? You google or youtube? That is what I did too! I ended up in Lisa Lendwayâ€™s website which by the way she built wiht distil;and there is also a Youtube video. This was already good enough to set up my webpage over night!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
