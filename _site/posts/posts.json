    "contents": "\r\nIn my inaugural blog post, I am excited to share a comprehensive list of resources that proved instrumental in the construction of this website. For those who may be newcomers to the realms of both R markdown and distil, I trust that this post will serve as a valuable aid. While I myself am relatively new to these tools, I have grown more at ease with markdown through various projects. A fortunate advantage is the wealth of individuals who have generously shared their insights and are enthusiastic about guiding fellow learners like us.\r\nMy initiation into the world of distil occurred through a mention on Twitter. How do you usually respond to news of something new? Researching on Google or exploring YouTube videos perhaps? I embarked on a similar journey! Eventually, I stumbled upon Lisa Lendwayâ€™s website which, by the way, she constructed using distil. Furthermore, there is also a Youtube video. This was already good enough to set up my webpage over night!\r\nMy subsequent step involved exploring various example websites as provided by the distil documentation. . I am sure by googling a bit more, one can find many other example websites built with distil that provide code publicly. One of these sources is definitely Open Source Football.\r\nI soon realized I had forgotten to add my email to the website. I wanted to have it on the main page as a footer, and realized Open Source Football had a footer too! Checking their GitHub, I realized they had a _footer.html file which must be what I need. Again, with some googling I found out about rstudio4edu which has a lot of information on markdown, distill, and bookdown. Next step was to make the footer look nice! I searched for HTML email tag and envelope icon, and added them into the html (actually a text) file; and boom! Very easy!\r\nI am still constructing my website, thus this blog will be updated constantly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
