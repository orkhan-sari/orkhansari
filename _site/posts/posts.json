For those who may be newcomers to the realms of both R markdown and distil, I trust that this post will serve as a valuable aid. While I myself am relatively new to these tools, I have grown more at ease with markdown through various projects. A fortunate advantage is the wealth of individuals who have generously shared their insights and are enthusiastic about guiding fellow learners like us.\r\nMy initiation into the world of distil occurred through a mention on Twitter. How do you usually respond to news of something new? Researching on Google or exploring YouTube videos perhaps? I embarked on a similar journey! Eventually, I stumbled upon Lisa Lendwayâ€™s website which, by the way, she constructed using distil. Furthermore, there is also a Youtube video. This was already good enough to set up my webpage over night!\r\nMy subsequent step involved exploring various example websites as provided by the distil documentation. . I am sure by googling a bit more, one can find many other example websites built with distil that provide code publicly. One of these sources is definitely Open Source Football.\r\nI am still constructing my website, thus this blog will be updated constantly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
